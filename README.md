                                                   HDL Overview
 Hardware description languages (HDL) offer a way to design circuits
using text-based descriptions
 HDL describes hardware using keywords and expressions.
 Representations for common forms
» Logic expressions, truth tables, functions, logic gates
 Any combinational or sequential circuit
 HDLs have two objectives
 Allow for testing/verification using computer simulation
» Includes syntax for timing, delays
 Allow for synthesis
» Synthesizable HDL
 The two forms often differ !
 We will use synthesizable subset of verilog
 Two primary hardware description languages
 VHDL
 Verilog
